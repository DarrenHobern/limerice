Vidtech Services is able to offer you a personalised service, tailored to meet your needs.
<BR>
This includes inspection of new installations, permanent supplies, new or upgraded switchboards, new mains and earthing systems.  
EWOF's for the following types of connectable installations:  
Caravans, Campervans, Motorhomes and any other mobile items. e.g. coffee trailers, food trailers or anything that can be connected to a power supply.  
As any connectable installation is required to be re-certified every four years, the re-inspections are carried out to meet the requirements of the Electricity Act, Regulations and the relevant Safety standards.

 If required we can carry out any repairs necessary to enable the issuing of the electrical warrant of fitness. (EWOF)
