Vidtech Services is an EWRB approved Competency Programme Provider.  
As part of the Refresher Training programme, you will be provided with the information that will keep you informed and up-to-date on essential regulatory requirements and changes.  
The online e-modules are a prerequisite of the training, so you must have complete this prior to any refresher course.
If you have already completed the e-modules, you will need to be able to provide proof of completion. The completion certificate is all that is required. For further information on the e-learning modules, see the links below.    
As the expiry date of practise licences have now changed to the anniversary date of your registration, courses will be run as soon as there are sufficient numbers.  
Training courses typically have 8 to 10 participants; however small courses maybe run with prior arrangement.
