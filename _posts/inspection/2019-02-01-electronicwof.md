Testing and Certification  

Inspections  <br>Periodic Re-inspections

  The re-inspection of transportable installations is required to be carried out every 4 years.  This is to ensure that it continues to be compliant with the relevant standard and when tested will continue to be safe to use.  Part of the testing, particularly in  socket outlets, is to ensure that all connections remain secure and have not loosened with the vibration that is caused by the movement  of travelling on roads and the like.  


##### EWOF's for the following types of connectable installations:  

  - Caravans  
  - Campervans
  - Motorhomes
  - Transportable installations (eg. tempoary site offices, tiny houses, mobile classrooms)
  - Food trailers (eg. coffee trailers, food trailers)  
  - Out buildings and cabins

##### If required we can carry out any repairs necessary to enable the issuing of the electrical warrant of fitness (EWOF).
